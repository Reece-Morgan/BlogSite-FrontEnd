## Using the Site

This project is the frontend side of a blogging website. Whilst using this site, users can:
- access and read any blog post,
- login
- register
- create, edit and delete their own blog posts

Any and all users can access the homepage to view any blog post that is available. Only authenticated users can create their own posts. Authenticated users can also access 
their User Dashboard by clicking their username in the header. From this Dashboard, a user can create new posts and edit or delete any of their exsiting posts.

Once an authenticated user has finished with their blog posts, they can log out via the link in the header on any page (home, blog or dashboard pages)
